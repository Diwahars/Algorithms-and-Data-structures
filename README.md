# Algorithms-and-Data-structures
Common data structure and algorithms implemented in Python. Previously I wrote them as separate Python scripts. But once I discovered jupyter notebooks, there's no going back. I have also added as much unit tests as possible. For unit testing, I have used `unittest` and `nose` modules in Python.

## Data structures
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked list
 * Singly linked list
 * Doubly linked list
 * Circular linked list
* Tree
 * Binary search tree
 * Trie
* Hash table

# Algorithms
* Searching
 * Linear Search
 * Binary Search
* Sorting
 * Bubble sort
 * Insertion sort
 * Selection sort
 * Merge sort
 * Quicksort
* Backtracking problems
* Divide and Conquer
* Recursion
* Greedy

# SQL
SQL queries for problems on [sql-ex.ru](sql-ex.ru).

If you find any errors or write some new unit tests, just create your own branch and send a pull request.

## Note
If you need more explanation, I have written some blog posts on my website about some data structures. Visit [chinmayapatanaik.com](chinmayapatanaik.com).
